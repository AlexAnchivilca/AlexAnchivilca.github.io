# Setting up my Blog

Here's the table of contents:

1. Inserting pictures 
{:toc}

## Iserting pictures
To **insert** picture just follow the next sequence <br>
```python
[image_description](image_path)
```

For instance: <br>


![](../images/UQ2.jpg)

As can be seen, the image is too big. So, if you want to resize your image change the sequence to: <img src="path" width="XXX" height="XXX"> <br>

<img src="../images/UQ2.jpg" width="150" height="150"> 

You can play with it :)
