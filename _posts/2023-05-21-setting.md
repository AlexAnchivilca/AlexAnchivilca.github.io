# Setting up my Blog

Here's the table of contents:

1. Inserting pictures 
{:toc}

## Inserting pictures
To **insert** picture just follow the next sequence <br>
```python
![image_description](image_path)
```

For instance: <br>

![](/images/UQ2.jpg "Big UQ Logo")

As can be seen, the image is too big. So, if you want to resize your image change the sequence to:
```python
<img src="path" width="XXX" height="XXX">
```

<img src="/images/UQ2.jpg" width="150" height="150"> 

You can play with it :)

## Formatting text
```python
To bold a sentence, use **sentence**
To use italics, use *sentence* 
To combine both use **sentence 1 _sentence2_**
```
