In this post I am going to present some **take-home** messages of the first lesson of the FASTAI [course](https://course.fast.ai/) <br>
## Take-home message 1
Multiple AI programs such as [Dall-e-2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) or [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) uses Deep Learning techiniques to create art from simple sentences. <br>

In this class, professor showed some examples of images created by using this approach. See image below:
