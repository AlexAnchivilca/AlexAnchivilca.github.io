In this post I am going to present some **take-home** messages of the first lesson of the FASTAI [course](https://course.fast.ai/) <br>

## Take-home message 1
-Multiple AI programs such as [Dall-e-2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) or [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) uses Deep Learning techniques to create art from simple sentences. <br>
In this class, professor showed some examples of images created by using this approach. See image below:<br>

## Take-home message 2
-Myth and truth of deep learning.
| Myth| Truth |
|-|-|
| Require lots of math | High school math is enough |
| Require a lot of data | Good results can be achieved with less than 50 samples |
| Require expensive computer | You can access to virtual computers for free|
